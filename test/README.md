# Cloudrail: context-aware cloud security tool

## Test examples

To try any of these test cases, go to the specific test case's directory, create a TF plan and run an evaluation with Cloudrail. For example:

```
~/test/aws/terraform/public_access_security_groups_port_rule/port_22_allowed_from_internet_to_ec2_explicit # terraform init
~/test/aws/terraform/public_access_security_groups_port_rule/port_22_allowed_from_internet_to_ec2_explicit # terraform plan -out=plan.out
~/test/aws/terraform/public_access_security_groups_port_rule/port_22_allowed_from_internet_to_ec2_explicit # cloudrail run
Enter terraform plan file path: /root/test/aws/terraform/public_access_security_groups_port_rule/port_22_allowed_from_internet_to_ec2_explicit/plan.out
Enter root directory of the .tf files. (Leave empty to use the plan path) []:

NOTE: You do not need to run "terraform apply" as Cloudrail can simply analyze the plan. If you would like, you can apply the entire test case in your AWS account and see you are getting the same results.
If you'd like to be even more creative, you can apply some of the resources first, then run a plan that will add only the remaining resources. Cloudrail is capable of understanding all of these scenarios.
